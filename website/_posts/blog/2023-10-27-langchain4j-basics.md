While a growing body of tooling exists to build LLM applications in python or node.js, Java has been slow to catch up.
Luckily, the [LangChain4J]() library is now here. It's self-described as a java port for the popular [LangChain]() library,
but it certainly doesn't match capabilities 1 to 1. We will be exploring the basics of LangChain4J in this post.

**LLM Application?** This is a term I'm using to describe a relatively new phenomenon. It's an application that uses a
large language model. It doesn't necessarily need to be a chatbot, as you will see in some of the following examples.

Many people have limited themselves to only imagining LLMs being deployed in the context of a chatbot. This is so unfortunate.

These large-language-models are wonderful at using new information, making decisions, creating tasks, using tools, and
more. 

Finding new ways to weave these models into our legacy applications will unlock a fun new era of programming.
